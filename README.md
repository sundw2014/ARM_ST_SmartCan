# ARM_ST_SmartCan
**This repo is set by THU_Skyworks team.** All the basic codes as well as drawings are stored here. We tend to build 
a All-dtrection moved smartcan which can automatically picks up what you throw in the air. And simultaneously, we tend 
to add some interactive functions to it so that it can be more likely to be a household one.
